# Signavio Workflow Accelerator Connector

Signavio Workflow Accelerator Connector is a RESTful web service which can be used to retrieve data from an external SQL Database and forward this data to Signavio's Workflow Accelerator.

![Overview](docs/images/connector-network-diagram.png?raw=true "Overview")

The Workflow Accelerator can then use this data to populate form fields within a workflow.

![Workflow Connector Example](docs/images/workflow-connector-example.gif?raw=true "Workflow Connector Example")

This README file and the associated [wiki](https://github.com/signavio/workflow-connector/wiki) will show how to install and configure the Signavio Workflow Accelerator Connector.

## Features

- Perform basic CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations on database entries through a standard RESTful API
- Supports multiple SQL databases (MySQL, PostgresSQL, Oracle)

### Installation (on premise)

The workflow connector by be installed by copying the executable file, and related configuration files from the [release page](https://github.com/signavio/workflow-connector/releases), to the appropriate directory on the server. Alternatively, the executable can be generated by compiling the source code as shown below.

#### Compilation from source (on linux)

1. Download and install go from your distribution's package manager (for ubuntu `apt-get install go`) and make sure you are using version >= 1.11

2. Clone the github repository

```sh
> git clone https://github.com/signavio/workflow-connector
Cloning into 'workflow-connector'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 295, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (295/295), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (150/150), done.
remote: Total 1231 (delta 152), reused 229 (delta 100), pack-reused 936
Receiving objects: 100% (1231/1231), 481.82 KiB | 248.00 KiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (590/590), done.
```

3. Compile the source code
```sh
> cd workflow-connector
> go build -o workflow-connector main.go
```

The executable is called `workflow-connector` and is located in the current directory.

If you have TLS enabled and want to listen on port 443 without running the executable as root, you can set the proper permissions using the `setcap` command

```sh
> setcap 'cap_net_bind_service=+ep' ~/workflow-connector/workflow-connector
```

### Running workflow-connector as a service

The workflow connector can be configured to run on boot as a service. This can be accomplished by executing the `workflow-connector` and providing the `-service` parameter with the `install` subcommand. Note, when doing so, you **must** also provide the absolute path to the configuration directory using the `-config-dir` parameter:

```sh
# provide the -service parameter with the `install` subcommand
# and the absolute path to the configuration directory
> ./workflow-connector/workflow-connector -service install -config-dir /workflow-connector/config
```

This will install the workflow-connector as a windows service, if it is running in windows, or as a systemd unit,  if running on linux. This assumes that the user running the `-service install` command has sufficient rights to install services and the configuration files are stored in the directory specified by the `-config-dir` parameter

### Configuration

All program and environment specific configuration settings are done in the `config.yml` and `descriptor.json` files, which should be located in the directory specified in the `-config-dir` parameter.

#### The `config.yml` file

The `config.yml` file should include settings specific to your environment. The following snippet shows an example of what this could look like. Other examples can be found in the [config.example.yml](https://github.com/signavio/workflow-connector/blob/master/config/config.example.yml). It is also possible to override the values in the `config.yml` file by using environment variables. For example, you could specify the database connection url by exporting the environment variable `DATABASE_URL=mysql://john:84mj29rSgHz@172.17.8.28?database=test`. 

```yml
port: 443
database:
  driver: goracle
  # url = oracle://username:password@address/service_name
  url: oracle://bob:l120arSgHz@172.17.8.2/test
tls:
  enabled: false
  publicKey: ./config/server.crt
  privateKey: ./config/server.key
auth:
  username: wfauser
  # password = Foobar
  passwordHash: "$argon2i$v=19$m=512,t=2,p=2$SUxvdmVTYWx0Q2FrZXMhISE$UgSWnBB5OkdqMAu+OfvwNLVMUijMnnmVm0kRSfmS9E8"
logging: true
```

##### port

The port to listen on. This should be port 443 if you have TLS enabled otherwise you can choose any other custom port.

##### database

The `driver` option specifies which golang driver will be used to communicate with the database. A list of supported databases and their corresponding drivers can be found on the [Supported Databases](https://github.com/signavio/workflow-connector/wiki/Supported-Databases) page. The `url` option specifies the connection parameters for the database such as username, password and IP Address.

##### tls

Setting the `enabled` option to true will force the workflow connector web service to only use TLS. The `publicKey` and `privateKey` option should point to the location of the public key and private key that the web service will use for TLS connections. *Note*: if your TLS certificate was generated through intermediate Certificate Authorities (CAs), make sure to bundle all of the intermediate CAs' certificates in the workflow connector server's certificate. 

##### auth

The workflow connector web service will only respond to clients that provide valid HTTP basic access authentication credentials. These authentication credentials are specified in the `username` and `passwordHash` options. The `username` option stores the username required for HTTP basic access authentication as plain text, and the `passwordHash` option stores the salted and hashed password using [argon2](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/lib/passlib.hash.argon2.html). You can use the following commands in python to generate a valid argon2 password hash for the `passwordHash` option.

1. Install passlib using python `pip`

```sh

pip install passlib argon2_cffi

```

2. Use the python shell in the command line to generate an argon2 password hash with a digest size of 32 bytes

```python

>>> from passlib.hash import argon2

>>> argon2.using(digest_size=32).hash("password")

'$argon2i$v=19$m=102400,t=2,p=8$916LEeL8f8+ZM8Z4D0EIAQ$JitmfHTb4UZxm6TqgPLdG9Sbqn5U3LHnrfO9qp3ni6U'

>>> 

```

##### logging

Setting the `logging` option to true will make the workflow-connector output debug level logging to standard output

#### The `descriptor.json` file

The workflow connector also needs to know the schema of the data it will receive from the database. This is stored in the connector descriptor file `descriptor.json` and an example is provided in the [config](https://github.com/signavio/workflow-connector/blob/master/config/descriptor.json) folder. If you need a step by step guide on how to create a `descriptor.json` file, you can follow the instructions in the [wiki](https://github.com/signavio/workflow-connector/wiki/Creating-Descriptor-File). Also refer to the [workflow documentation](https://docs.signavio.com/userguide/workflow/en/integration/connectors.html#connector-descriptor) for more information. 

### Run the service

After the workflow connector has been configured, you can execute it on the command line and do some rudimentary testing to see if its working correctly.

```sh
> ./workflow-connector/workflow-connector
I: 12:34:56 server is ready and listening on port 8000
```
If you open a web browser on the same server that is running the workflow-connector and connect to the url `http://localhost:8000` you should be prompted from the workflow connector to enter in a username and password. After you have entered the correct credentials, you should see the output of the `descriptor.json` file in your web browser.
